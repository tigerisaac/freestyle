 * The Audio File Transcription plugin. Its user-facing surface is the

 * to the local server's `/api/transcribe` endpoint via the host bridge.
 *
 * The plugin's hook module is intentionally light — it has no pipeline hooks,
 * since transcribing dropped files doesn't alter live dictation. `setup` only
 * announces the plugin in logs.
