# Local MLX ASR (Qwen3)

Freestyle can use **on-device Qwen3-ASR** via [mlx-audio](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio) on Apple Silicon.

## Requirements

- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1+)
- Packaged app: downloaded `mlx_asr_worker` runtime
- Development fallback: Python 3.12+ with `pip install mlx-audio`

Optional: set `FREESTYLE_PYTHON` to your venv’s `python` if it is not on `PATH`.
Optional: set `FREESTYLE_MLX_ASR_WORKER` to a frozen worker executable.

## Setup

Packaged app:

- Open **Settings -> Models -> Voice**
- Press **Download** on a Qwen3 ASR row
- Press **Use** after the download finishes

Development fallback:

```bash
python3 -m pip install mlx-audio "huggingface_hub[hf_xet]"
```

Model weights download from Hugging Face into the normal HF cache.

## Vocabulary / keywords

Vocabulary terms are passed to Qwen3 ASR as context when using `local-mlx`.
The MLX path builds on the shared ASR vocabulary-bias pipeline and sends terms
as `Technical terms: ...` so Qwen can prefer names, brands, and phrases the user
has saved.

## Architecture

- Node server spawns `scripts/mlx_asr_server.py` as a local stdio worker
- Packaged builds spawn a cached frozen `mlx_asr_worker` executable,
  so users do not need a system Python or a `pip install`
- Model stays loaded in the worker process for low latency, unless the
  keep-alive setting is `0`
- Audio is written to a temporary WAV/PCM file and sent to the worker by path
- `POST /api/transcribe` uses the configured default voice model
- Settings -> Models -> Local MLX memory controls how long the worker stays
  loaded after each request. `0` means cold start every request; `10` keeps the
  model warm for ten idle minutes.

## Development

```bash
# Status
curl http://127.0.0.1:PORT/api/mlx-asr/status

# Start worker manually
python3 scripts/mlx_asr_server.py --model mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-5bit
```
